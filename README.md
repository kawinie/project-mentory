# Mentory

Mentory is an innovative online platform where people can get mentored by real industry experts in real-time instead of taking boring online courses.

## How to run Mentory locally
### Strapi server & database
1. Clone and open the project on your local computer.
2. Open two terminals.
3. In one terminal, switch to the `services/strapi` directory.
4. Install all dependencies with `npm i`.
5. Run the command `npm run develop`.
6. After a few seconds, you should be able to access the Strapi server via the link printed to the terminal. 
### Next.js frontend app
7. In the other terminal, switch to the root directory. 
8. Install all dependencies with `npm i`.
9. Run the command `npm run dev` on Mac and Linux or `npm run windows-dev` on Windows.
10. After a few seconds, you should be able to access the app via the link printed to the terminal.

Note: You will need some environment variables set in your .env file for Strapi to work properly. Contact the devs for that information.
