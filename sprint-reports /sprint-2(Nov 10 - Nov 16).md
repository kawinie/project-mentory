# Sprint 2 (Nov 10 - Nov 16)

**Scrum Master:** Atsu

## Sprint Goal

In this sprint, the team would like to discuss and create wireframes of our application. It is crucial to create low-fidelity designs because the team needs to have the same idea about what our product do and don't. The team has agreed that it should not be just layouts or structures. Of course, the design does not have to be beautiful, but it should cover all functionalities for each screen. Especially, it is important to define what functionalities we should have for each card component of the main screen this week because it is a main functionality of our app. We are going to prepare for the design review session that will be held on 11/20.
