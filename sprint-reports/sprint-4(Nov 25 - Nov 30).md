# Sprint #4 (Nov 25 - Nov 30)

**Scrum Master:** @Toshiki Chiba 

## Sprint Goal

In this sprint, the team would like to finalize a prototype design for 5 different screens, and to set up the code base that the team will be developing the prototype on. The prototype design will consist of the landing page, the login and signup page, the search results page, the mentor profile page, and the user profile page. These screens will be reviewed by the team during one of our standup meetings. Finally, the code repository will be set up on GitHub where we will be developing the prototype on.
