# Sprint 1 (Nov 2 - Nov 9)

**Scrum Master:** Kawin

## Sprint Goal

Before we dive head-first into coding, the team would like to allocate two sprints for research and to get familiar with some of the technologies we are going to be using. This is also a chance for each team member to brush up their basic web skills including HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as React.

As a basic training, all team members should complete NextJS walkthrough and convince yourself that TypeScript is good

- **NextJS** provides a backend support and allows us to achieve server-rendering while utilizing React.
- **TypeScript** is a typed superset of JS that allows static analysis to take place leading to a codebase that is more maintainable and less bug

## Scrum Record

Each team member has managed to complete NextJS walk-through. Prior to the completion of sprint 1, the team had concerns about if we will be able to learn all the technologies required for an extensible and maintainable codebase. But Those concerns have now been addressed. We are confident that we will be able to acquire new skills as needed by this project.
