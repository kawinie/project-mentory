# Sprint 3 (Nov 17 - 23)

**Scrum Master:** @Jett Seale

## Sprint Goal

In this sprint, the team would like to create a website navigation flow chart, finish 5 more screen design prototypes, and put together a slideshow presentation for the upcoming design review presentation. The website navigation flow chart will outline how the different screens in the website will be connected, and how a user will navigate through the entire site. The 5 new screen design prototypes will outline the landing page, mentor profile page, mentee profile page, product cards page, and log in page. Finally, the slideshow presentation will include the project goals, the primary technical hurdles, the process flow, our tech stack and tool set, the website design prototypes, and our perceived future challenges.
